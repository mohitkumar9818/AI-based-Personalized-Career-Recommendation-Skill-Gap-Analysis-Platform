The AI-Based Personalized Career Recommendation & Skill Gap Analysis Platform is an intelligent web application designed to help students and professionals discover the most suitable career paths based on their skills, resume, and behavioral tendencies.

Users often feel confused about which career is best for them, what skills they lack, and which courses they should learn. This platform solves that real-life problem using AI, NLP, and Machine Learning.

The system extracts skills from a user’s resume, analyzes behavioral patterns through a short assessment, and then predicts career paths that match the user’s strengths. Along with this, it identifies the skill gaps and recommends personalized courses to bridge those gaps.

This project acts like a virtual career counselor, giving accurate and personalized career guidance using AI.
